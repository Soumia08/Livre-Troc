# Livre-Troc

An application for exchanging used books developed using Java Spring Boot REST API, Spring Security, React JS, and Bootstrap:

The application allows users to register, log in, and create profiles. Users can add books they want to exchange and browse through books offered by other users.

The application uses Java Spring Boot REST API to communicate with the database and provide a secure API to clients. Spring Security is used to protect application resources and authenticate users.

The front-end of the application is built using React JS and Bootstrap. Users can search for books using filters such as title, author, and category.

In summary, this application enables users to securely and efficiently exchange used books through a user-friendly interface and reliable API.

The application is currently being deployed on the internet, but attached are screenshots of various scenarios in the application, including registration, login, borrowing, closing a borrowing, and adding a book...
